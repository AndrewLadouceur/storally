<p class="details">
	Storally was founded to address the concerns of UBC students when they stumbled upon the following question- Where to keep all this stuff for the summer? Since then, Storally has organically grown to help find students a place to store their stuff.
We are on our way to open our platform to everyone including travellers, businessman and eventually organizations. 
<br />
<br />
Storally connects space owners with people looking to store their stuff temporarily. Trust and human connection are the two values that we focus on the most. We believe that the world is more interconnected than ever before and we want to be facilitators in this sharing economy.
<br />
<br />
Our mission is to maximize utility with convenience.
